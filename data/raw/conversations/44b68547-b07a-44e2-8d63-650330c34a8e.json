We're a data processing solution that helps companies like yours optimize their data infrastructure and gain valuable insights. I came across your company, Twilio SendGrid, and noticed that you're handling a massive volume of emails every month. I'd love to explore how our solution can help you streamline your data processing and improve deliverability.",
