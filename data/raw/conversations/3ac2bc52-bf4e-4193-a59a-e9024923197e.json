However, I'd like to propose that DeepData AI can actually complement your existing infrastructure, rather than replacing it. We can work with your team to integrate our solution with your current setup, and our flexible pricing model can help you scale up or down as needed. As for timing, I'd be happy to schedule a demo for when you're ready, and we can provide a proof of concept to show you the value we can bring.",
