I came across your company, and I noticed you're using Datadog for cloud monitoring. I'd love to explore how our solution can complement your existing tools and help you gain more insights from your data.",

However, our solution is designed to work seamlessly with existing tools like Datadog, and it can help you process and analyze large amounts of data more efficiently. We've seen companies like yours achieve significant cost savings and performance improvements by leveraging our AI-powered data processing capabilities.",

Plus, I'd need to run this by our procurement team and get approval from our CFO. Can you tell me more about your pricing model and how it would work for a company of our size?",
