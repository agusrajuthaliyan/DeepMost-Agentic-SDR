We're a data processing solution that helps companies like Plaid optimize their financial data and improve their overall customer experience. I came across your company and was impressed with the work you're doing in the fintech space. Can you tell me a little bit about your current data processing setup?",

We've worked with several companies in the fintech space and have seen some great results. For example, one of our customers was able to increase their data processing speed by 30% after implementing our solution. Would you be open to hearing more about how we could help Plaid?",
